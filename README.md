There has been a constant evolution from first computer starting from electro-mechanical switches and relays to vacuum tubes triodes, to transistors and the current era Metal Oxide Field-Effect Transistor(MOSFETs). 
Each evolution has had a significant improvement in computational and power parameters compared to its previous generation technology.
According to Moore’s law number of transistors in a chip doubles after every 18 months, but seeing the current trend and the “MOS” technology limitations it will reach a saturation.
There is a need to research and develop other avenues of semiconductor industry.
QCA is found to be most feasible, efficient and advantageous in terms of parallelism, implementation, accuracy, computation and area on chip. 
In this paper QCA as a technology and its implementation in semiconductor industry is discussed. 
In this paper construction and design of basic gates, wires and clocking cycles using QCA has been comprehensively discussed.
